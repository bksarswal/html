    <h1>what is rel attribute in link</h1>
    <pre>
        The rel attribute in an HTML <.link> (or <.a>) element
             specifies the relationship between the current document 
             and the linked resource. It is commonly used for defining
              the type of link or relationship when adding external
               resources like stylesheets, or for metadata in <.a> links.</pre>


    <h1>what is "initial scale"</h1>
    <pre>
        
"initial scale" in HTML, it often refers to the initial-scale property in the <.meta>
     tag for setting the viewport in responsive web design. This is crucial for defining
      how a website is displayed on different devices, especially mobile ones.

Here's an example:

html
 code 
    <.meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0">
   
Explanation of initial-scale
<h2>Purpose: Sets the initial zoom level of the website 
    when it first loads on a device.</h2>
Value: A number that represents the zoom level.
1.0: Default scale, meaning the site appears at its normal size.
0.5: Zooms out, making the site appear smaller.
2.0: Zooms in, making the site appear larger.
Related Properties
The viewport meta tag can also include:

width=device-width: Sets the viewport width to match the device's screen width.
maximum-scale: Limits the maximum zoom level.
minimum-scale: Sets the minimum zoom level.
user-scalable: Determines if users can manually zoom in/out.pre>
