    <h1>body tag</h1>
    <pre>


            The <.body> tag in HTML defines the main content of an HTML document 
                that is visible to users in the browser. Everything inside the <.body> 
                    tag is rendered on the webpage.
            
            Structure of <.body>
            The <.body> tag is a container for all the visible elements of the webpage, including:
            
            Text
            Images
            Videos
            Links
            Tables
            Forms
            Scripts
            Syntax
            html
            Copy code
            <.body>
                <!-- Content goes here -->
            </.body>
            Attributes of <.body>
            The <.body> tag supports several attributes for styling and interaction. Common attributes include:
            
            Global Attributes (Supported by most HTML tags)
            
            id: Unique identifier for the <.body> element.
            class: Applies one or more CSS classes for styling.
            style: Inline CSS for styling the .body.
            title: Provides additional information (shown as a tooltip).
            Event Attributes (For JavaScript events)
            
            onload: Executes a script when the .body has finished loading.
            html
            Copy code
            <.body onload="alert('Page has loaded!')">
            onunload: Executes a script when the .body is unloaded.
            html
            Copy code
            <.body onunload="alert('Page is closing!')">
            Other event attributes like onclick, onkeydown, onmousemove, etc.
            Deprecated Attributes (Not recommended for modern use) These attributes were used in
             older HTML versions (e.g., bgcolor, background, text, link, vlink, alink). They have
              been replaced by CSS.
            Example:
            
            html
            Copy code
            <.body bgcolor="lightblue">
            
            
            Notes
            The <.body> tag is mandatory in every HTML document.
            It should contain all the content visible to the user, whereas the <.head>
                 contains metadata and links to resources like CSS and JavaScript files.
            For modern web development, prefer styling the <.body> using CSS instead of
                 deprecated HTML attributes.
